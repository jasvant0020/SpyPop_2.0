# 🕵️‍♂️ SpyPop_2.0 Media – Secret Message, Image & Audio Popup with Self-Destruct
SpyPop Media is the extended version of my original SpyPop project.
While the classic SpyPop only supported secret text messages, this upgraded version can now handle Text, Images, and Audio messages – all wrapped in a dramatic spy-style popup with a self-destruct countdown.

This project is for educational and demonstration purposes only. It ensures privacy for temporary sensitive information and securely removes all traces after viewing.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 Encrypt & Decrypt
  - main_media.py – Encrypts text, images, or audio files.
